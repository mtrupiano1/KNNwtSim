Title: Implementation of KNN forecasting using a weighted similarity metric for time series decomposition
Version: 0.1.0.9000
Author: Matt Trupiano
Maintainer: Matt Trupiano <yourself@somewhere.net>
Description: This package contains functions to assist in the implmentation of K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) forecasting using a weighted similarity metric, \{S_w}. It is intended in particular for univariate time series problems where recent observations, seasonal patterns, and exogenous predictors are all relevent in predicting future observations of the series in question.
