Title: Implementation of KNN forecasting using a weighted similarity metric for univariate forecasting in the presence of exogenous predictors
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Matthew Trupiano
Maintainer: Matthew Trupiano <matthew.trupiano.professional@gmail.com>
Description: This package contains functions to assist in the implmentation of K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) forecasting using a weighted similarity metric, \{S_w}. It is intended in particular for univariate time series problems where recent observations, seasonal patterns, and exogenous predictors are all relevent in predicting future observations of the series in question.
