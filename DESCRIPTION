Title: K Nearest Neighbor Forecasting with a Tailored Similarity Metric
Version: 0.2.0.9000
Author: Matthew Trupiano
Maintainer: Matthew Trupiano <matthew.trupiano.professional@gmail.com>
Description: Functions to implement K Nearest Neighbor forecasting using a weighted similarity metric tailored to the problem of forecasting univariate time series where recent observations, seasonal patterns, and exogenous predictors are all relevant in predicting future observations of the series in question. For more information on the formulation of this similarity metric please see Trupiano (2021) <arXiv:2112.06266v1>.
