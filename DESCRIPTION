Title: Implementation of K Nearest Neighbor Forecasting using a Weighted Similarity Metric for Univariate Forecasting in the Presence of Exogenous Predictors
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Matthew Trupiano
Maintainer: Matthew Trupiano <matthew.trupiano.professional@gmail.com>
Description: This package contains functions to assist in the implementation of K Nearest Neighbor forecasting using a weighted similarity metric, \{S_w}. It is intended in particular for univariate time series problems where recent observations, seasonal patterns, and exogenous predictors are all relevant in predicting future observations of the series in question.
