## Submission
This submission addresses the feedback received from CRAN:
* Title in DESCRIPTION reduced to less than 65 characters
* Description update to remove unknown markup 
* Description update to provide Similarity Measure reference. There is currently no formal reference I am aware of, this is a measure I proposed as part of my MS capstone/thesis. I plan to write and submit a more formal article, featuring the package if it is approved to CRAN, in the coming months. In the meantime the best public reference is the package README.md on github https://github.com/mtrupiano1/knnwtsim/blob/main/README.md. I added a note directing users there in the Description.
