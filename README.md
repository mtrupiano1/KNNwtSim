# knnwtsim

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of knnwtsim is to provide a package to share and implement a
project I have been working on around the use of KNN forecasting in
situations where the response series of interest can be predicted by a
combination of itsâ€™ own recent realizations, its own periodic patterns,
and by the values of one or multiple exogenous predictors.

The package and project are focused primarily into two components. The
first being calculation of a similarity measure which takes into account
all three factors listed above (`S_w`), and can weight the degree to
which each component contributed to the overall similarity. The second
being the usage of this measure to identify neighbors and perform KNN
regression.

## Formulation

### Weighted Similarity Measure `S_w`

The Similarity measure I have formulated for incorporating the three
factors listed above is:

`S_w = alpha*S_t + beta*S_p + gamma*S_x`

Where `S_t` is the matrix calculated by `StMatrixCalc()` to measure
similarity in terms of pure recency between all observations. `alpha` is
the weight between 0-1 assigned to this matrix in the calculation of
`S_w`.

`S_p` is the matrix calculated by `SpMatrixCalc()` to measure similarity
in terms of where each observation falls along a periodic cycle relative
to all others. `beta` is the weight between 0-1 assigned to this matrix
in the calculation of `S_w`.

`S_x` is the matrix calculated by `SxMatrixCalc()` to measure similarity
between all observations in terms of the values of one or more exogenous
predictors associated with a given observation. `gamma` is the weight
between 0-1 assigned to this matrix in the calculation of `S_w`.

The function `SwMatrixCalc()` calls each of these previous functions to
generate the final matrix to use in `knn.forecast()`

The weights `alpha`, `beta`, and `gamma` are recommended to be set so
that they sum to 1. In this case each element of `S_w` should also be
between 0-1, with the diagonal elements being equal to 1.

### KNN Forecasting

K Nearest Neighbors forecasting is implemented in this package through
the function `knn.forecast()`. Using a provided similarity matrix, note
that this function does not actually require `S_w` specifically is used,
the function will perform K Nearest Neighbors regression on each point
in a specified index `f.index.in`, returning the mean of the identified,
`k.in`, neighbors in the response series `y.in`.

Mathematically the estimate for a given point `y_t` is formulated as the
mean of the previous points in the series `y_i` identified to be in the
neighborhood of `y_t`, `K(y_t)`.

In the neighborhood `K(y_t)` will be the `k` observations of `y_i` with
the highest similarity to `y_t` of all eligible members of the time
series, meaning `i < t`. Currently in `knn.forecast()` this eligibility
constraint is enforced by only considering the rows of the similarity
matrix at indices which are not present in `f.index.in` when selecting
neighbors while performing KNN regression on each point in `f.index.in`,
thus preventing the corresponding points in `y.in` at those indices from
being selected as neighbors. Meaning there should not be rows of higher
index in your similarity matrix provided to `knn.forecast()` than the
max value in `f.index.in`, or the values of `y.in` at those indices will
be considered eligible neighbors.

## Installation

You can install the development version of knnwtsim from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mtrupiano1/knnwtsim")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows a full forecasting workflow:

``` r
library(knnwtsim)
## basic example code
data("simulation_master_list")
series.index <- 15
ex.series <- simulation_master_list[[series.index]]$series.lin.coef.chng.x

#Weights pre tuned by random search. In alpha, beta, gamma order   
pre.tuned.wts <- c(0.2788147,0.7209188,0.0002665336)
pre.tuned.k <- 11 

df <- data.frame(ex.series)
#Generate vector of time orders
df$t <- c(1:nrow(df))

#Generate vector of periods
nperiods <- simulation_master_list[[series.index]]$seasonal.periods
df$p <- rep(1:nperiods,length.out=nrow(df))

#Pull corresponding exogenous predictor(s)
